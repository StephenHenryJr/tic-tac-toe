# tic-tac-toe

Tic-Tac-Toe game created here. 

A lot of CSS used. 
JS functions used to add game logic. 

This code is for a basic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here's a summary of what the code does:

- The code initializes various elements such as the cells, board, restart button, and winning message.
- It sets the classes for 'x' and 'o', and defines the possible winning combinations.
- The game starts when the startGame() function is called.
- When the player clicks on a cell, handleClick() function is called.
- If the current player wins or if there is a draw, the endGame() function is called.
- If the game is a draw, the message "Draw!" is displayed, otherwise the message displays the winning player ("X's Win!" or "O's Win!").
- The function isDraw() is used to check if the game is a draw.
- The function placeMark() is used to place the marker on the board.
- The function swapTurns() is used to swap the turns between 'x' and 'o'.
- The function setBoardHoverClass() is used to set the class for the board based on the current player's turn.
- The function checkWin() is used to check if any of the winning combinations have been achieved.

Enjoyed this one. 
Might come back to it to change colors.
